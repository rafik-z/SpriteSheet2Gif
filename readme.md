# SpriteSheet2Gif


## Why did I decided to make this ?

Not a sexy name I know, but at least you can easily understand what this app is intended to.

While working on a few side projects, I've struggled more than once to generate GIFs from sprite sheets to make my 
animation easily shared between my team. Doing it by hand is quite painful and time-consuming.

So I've decided to make my own GIF generator which would take as input files sprite sheets.

## How is it going to be available ?

The first aim is to make it available as a web service with public API.
Maybe I'll make it as a library too.

## When will it be out ?

Dunno. Just begun coding :D Come back later...
